This file will explain how to reproduce the project. 

1. Create a website using html. Any website would work, no matter the contents. In this case, we used the website found in the "Website" folder of the repository.
   Make sure to put the following javascript code in your website to increment a counter on the machine you are using by utilizing cookies: 
        function updatePageVisitsCount() {
            // Check if the cookie exists
            var countCookie = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:^|.*;\s*)loadCount\s*=\s*([^;]*).*$)|^.*$/, "$1");
            
            // Parse the count from the cookie
            var count = parseInt(countCookie) || 0;

            // Increment the count
            count++;

            // Set the cookie with the new count (expires in 365 days)
            document.cookie = 'loadCount=' + count + '; max-age=' + (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

            // Display the count on the webpage
            document.getElementById('visits').innerText = count;
        }


2. Place the website into a git repository, to do this: 
    - Go on your preferred website (in this case, GitHub). 
    - Create an account or log in. 
    - Create a repository and give it the name you want (in our case, it is Site-for_Unix).
    - Create any file on your destop. 
    - Open your terminal and change your directory to the name of the new folder (cd [folder]).
    - Copy the link of the repository. In your terminal, type "git clone [link of the repository]". This will clone the repository in the folder and will create a new folder inside. 
    - Once the new folder is created after the cloning, type "cd [new_folder]" in the terminal.
    - Copy the folder of your website into the cloned folder. 
    - In the terminal, type "git add .". Next, type "git commit -m "added website". When everything has been committed, type "git push" in your terminal to push all the changes to the directory. 


3. Create a DigitalOcean account or Log into your account. This is the website for DigitalOcean: https://www.digitalocean.com/
   - Choose to use email, gmail, or link your github account.
   - You will be required to enter payment information. Please make sure this information is accurate, since DigitalOcean will block your account if you input the wrong information. 


4. Create you SSH Key
   - Open the terminal on your Linux based machine. 
   - Enter the command ssh-keygen. The terminal will show you the default recommended location to store your ssh key (/.ssh/id_rsa). You can however save it in another file if you wish to do so.

5. Create a new vps (Droplet)
   - When you have successfully accessed your account, press on the "Drolplets" button located on the left hand side of the screen, on the menu.
   - Click on "Create Droplet". This will bring you to another page. 
   - Select your region according to which is closest to you. 
   - You will then be shown options for images. For our project, we chose the Debian image.
   - You will be shown options for the size. For this project, we picked the Basic Shared CPU option for around 6.00$/month, as well as a Regular SSD. 
   - When choosing an authentication method, pick SSH Key. This ensures maximum security for your server and allows only certain machines to access the vps.
