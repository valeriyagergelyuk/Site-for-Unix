This file will explain how to reproduce the project. 

1. Create a website using html. Any website would work, no matter the contents. In this case, we used the website found in the "Website" folder of the repository.
   Make sure to put the following javascript code in your website to increment a counter on the machine you are using by utilizing cookies: 
        function updatePageVisitsCount() {
            // Check if the cookie exists
            var countCookie = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:^|.*;\s*)loadCount\s*=\s*([^;]*).*$)|^.*$/, "$1");
            
            // Parse the count from the cookie
            var count = parseInt(countCookie) || 0;

            // Increment the count
            count++;

            // Set the cookie with the new count (expires in 365 days)
            document.cookie = 'loadCount=' + count + '; max-age=' + (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

            // Display the count on the webpage
            document.getElementById('visits').innerText = count;
        }


2. Place the website into a git repository, to do this: 
    - Go on your preferred website (in this case, GitHub). 
    - Create an account or log in. 
    - Create a repository and give it the name you want (in our case, it is Site-for_Unix).
    - Create any file on your destop. 
    - Open your terminal and change your directory to the name of the new folder (cd [folder]).
    - Copy the link of the repository. In your terminal, type "git clone [link of the repository]". This will clone the repository in the folder and will create a new folder inside. 
    - Once the new folder is created after the cloning, type "cd [new_folder]" in the terminal.
    - Copy the folder of your website into the cloned folder. 
    - In the terminal, type "git add .". Next, type "git commit -m "added website". When everything has been committed, type "git push" in your terminal to push all the changes to the directory.
